# Using Feature Alignment Can Improve Clean Average Precision and Adversarial Robustness in Object Detection

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04382

This repository contains two parts: one is experiments on YOLO-V3 in folder yolov3-adv, the other is experiments on FASTER-RCNN-FPN in folder faster-rcnn-fpn-adv.
